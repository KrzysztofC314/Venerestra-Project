I know what you&#39;re going to say: &quot;Oh but Sam, they support you&quot;. No, they don&#39;t! Sure, I get meds, money, and all the expensive stuff, but does it matter? No! They don&#39;t even know what my favourite movie is! I study movies, Bri! That&#39;s kind of important. ... I&#39;m rambling again, ain&#39;t I?

Alvi: Check out this gneiss, guys!!!
Fritz: You look gneiss today *finger guns*
Alvi: Idiot...
Sachi://sends heart emoji//
Brigid: [Pretty cool.]
		[Wonderful.]
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
E: Ain&#39;t it just a rock?
Alvi: You can throw it at your enemies!
E: Gee, why so agressive??
Fritz: Anybody has any interesting stories from today?
E: Oh, I do!
Sam: I&#39;ve bumped into this handsome guy today. Literally bumped. He dropped all of his books because of me, and he had a looot of them, gosh, who reads that many books?? and then I was so stressed that instead of apologizing I said &quot;you&#39;re welcome&quot; and then I might have asked him out for a coffee as an apology. Anyway, I&#39;m a walking talking embarrassment lol.
Sachi: That&#39;s so cute &lt;3
Fritz: Seems nice though?
Brigid: [Congrats on getting a date, Sam.]
		[What went wrong then? So far so good.]
Sam: Oh, I forgot to mention I also spilled coffee onto him?
Alvi: Buahahahahahah
Alvi: You idiot!
Alvi: (affectionate)
Sam: Yeah... He was, to say the least, perplexed.
E: I had a similiar situation once.
Brigid: [Maybe it wasn&#39;t so terrible?]
		[Was he really that abashed?]
Sam: How am I supposed to know?! I ran away immediately.
Alvi: Ouch...
Sam: Maybe it&#39;s better he didn&#39;t get to drink this coffee? I heard this coffee vending machine has terrible drinks.
Brigid:You took him to a vending machine? For a coffee??
Sachi: Ow...
Alvi: Original choice.
E: That is in fact kind of embarrassing.
Sam: What? I&#39;m a poor student! Plus there was no cafe around at the moment.
Fritz: Maybe it would have been better to take him to an actual cafe, just different time?
Sam: Yep. I&#39;m a moron.
Fritz: Nah... don&#39;t say that. Accidents happen to everyone. On of them doesn&#39;t define you.
Sachi: Yeah...
E: Welp, you lost a potential date.
Brgid: [There will be many others.]
		[Maybe you still have a chance with him?]
E: Definitely not.
Sam: Anyway... How was everyone else&#39;s day?
Alvi: I sent you pics. I love my wanders. Only time when I truly feel free and at peace is when I&#39;m out in the wild.
Sachi: It must be so cool.
Alvi: Yeah... Everything is so big and majestic and... You know.
E: Don&#39;t you feel small then lol?
Alvi: Yeah, I&#39;m totally insignificant and the world around me is so big and so magnificent and this marvellous chaos is still working even tough it is a complete accident. It&#39;s sooo alive and beautiful!
E: Wow, ain&#39;t you a lunatic?
Brigid: [Huh, I must take walks more often then.]
		[I love the way you describe it.]
Fritz: I&#39;ve spent today helping at the animal shelter.
Alvi: DO YOU HAVE ANY PICTURES???
Sachi: Pls?
Fritz: Lol, of course //sends pics//
Brigid: [What a cutie!]
		[Nice pic &lt;3]
Fritz: Bri, what about you?
Brigid: Oh, nothing, exhaustingly normal day. Boring stuff.
Alvi: Mysterious as always.
Brigid: No, just nothing interesting happened, another cloudy, grey, and busy day.
Sam: Sure. You are just gloomily walking around your big old mansion.
Brigid: Something like that.
Sachi: Aesthetic.
E: Wow, depressively.
Fritz: And we love you for that, our dark rain cloud.

Fritz: Sure.
Brigid: Okay, okay, gee. I don&#39;t really feel comfortable around this guy.

Fritz: Yeah, probably you just need to get to know him better and that&#39;s it.
Sachi: He seems nice.
Sam: Yeah, I agree. You probably weren&#39;t as comfortable around us when you first met us as you are now.
Brigid: I guess...
Alvi: She&#39;s still not sure.
Sam: Bri?
Brigid: //iluzja wyboru//
	- It&#39;s not that. I can&#39;t really pinpoint it but there&#39;s something about him that is off, almost fake.
&#39;&#39;No, I can&#39;t say that. They won&#39;t believe me. They&#39;ll think I&#39;m overreacting and that I&#39;m prejudiced or something. No, so far nothing bad happened and I shouldn&#39;t be thinking this way, he&#39;s just a normal guy. What was I even thinking, starting this conversation?! That they will kick him out? No, it all leads nowhere.&#39;&#39;
	- No, you&#39;re right. He&#39;s fine.
Sam: Okay. But if something happens tell us, okay?
Brigid: Sure, whatever.
Alvi: If he does something we will be there to kick his ass.
Fritz: Of course but for now let&#39;s give him a chance, he seems okay.

Sam: Okay, how?

Brigid: I don&#39;t know! Just creepy. Like &quot;remember to smile&quot; or some wild philosophical rants. And all those emojis. I&#39;ve never seen this many emojis in my life!
Sam: So he&#39;s very socially awkward and indeed kind of odd??

Brigid: I don&#39;t know. Like it&#39;s there, in the back of my mind, you know, this big red flag.
Sam: So... the vibes are off?
[[Sam!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Sam!" tags="" position="3303,1900" size="100,100">Brigid: I need you to believe me! I **know** something is wrong and it&#39;s driving me crazy that I don&#39;t know what! He gives me the creeps, sends messages I don&#39;t really want to get, and I don&#39;t even know why he&#39;s bothering me so much!
Sam: Okay, okay, I believe you.
Brigid: Thanks...
Sam: I believe you think there&#39;s something wrong with him, but you know we can&#39;t kick a guy out based on the fact that the vibes are off.
Brigid: Please, don&#39;t say I&#39;m overreacting.
Sam: Woah, I&#39;m not. You&#39;re definitely not the one to overreact.
Sam: I&#39;m gonna keep an eye on him and if he does something, let me know immediately.
Brigid: Okay...
Sam: Remember, the worst case scenario is that you can just ignore him. And if it&#39;s even worse, we&#39;ll kick him out.
Brigid: Thank you, Sam.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="new message from E" tags="" position="2903,1701" size="100,100">E: Have you ever been in love?
Brigid: I&#39;m not sure. Love is such a heavy word. I&#39;m not even sure if I even had a crush before.
E: I was in love many times. Wonderful feeling. So powerful it can build you up to the sky and in the next second tear you down to the ground. Very strong tool, don&#39;t you think?
Brigid: Uh I guess??
E: I wish you would get to know what love is.

[[later with Sam]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="pogróżki" tags="" position="3302,199" size="100,100">Hi there, Brigid.
I have few questions for you :D
You and your freinds seem to be really close. But are you really? No secrets?
Do your friends know about your mom?
Do they know she was sick?
Do they know that she&#39;s dead?
Have you told them?
Do they know you&#39;re crazy? That sometimes you can&#39;t even get out of bed?
That you&#39;re disgusting, horrible, selfish person?
Don&#39;t answer.
I know what you would say.
And I don&#39;t care.
I know you would lie.
If you want to stick to the dishonest outward status quo, you have to change, Bri.
Because if you don&#39;t then well... everyone will know what a miserable pathetic creature you are.
You made some mistakes, Brigid. But I&#39;m lenient. I will let you fix them.
You have a week to do better.
I hope you will repent.
Have a good expiation :3</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="panic attack" tags="" position="2502,1403" size="100,100">Dad: Brigid? Brigid, hey, what&#39;s happening?
Brigid: *shakes head*
Dad: Brigid... can you look at me?
Brigid: *shakes head again*
Dad: Do you know where you are?
Brigid: ...home...
Dad: That&#39;s right. You are home. Do you know who I am?
Brigid: ...dad...
Dad: Do you see this plant?
Brigid: *nods*
Dad: Can you describe it for me?
Brigid: Dad... come on...
Dad: Come on.
Brigid: [It&#39;s green.]
		[It has holes.]
Dad: Good. What did you have for breakfast?
Brigid: Dad...
Dad: What did you have for breakfast, Brigid?
Brigid: [Toast and tea.]
		[Scrambled eggs and coffe.]
Dad: Will you do some breathing with me?
Brigid: Okay...
Dad: Inhale for 4, hold for 6, and exhale for 8 seconds, okay? I will count. In, 2, 3, 4. Hold, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Again, okay? In, 2, 3, 4. Hold, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... You&#39;re doing great sweetheart. Once again, alright? In, 2, 3, 4. Hold, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Better?

Brigid: Yeah, but who’s there?
Mr Canister: Ian Ferguson. From the hairdresser?
Brigid: Oh, okay. Yeah, I’m safe and sound within my four walls.
Mr Canister: I saw those creeps from the bus stop taking the same ride as you, so I wanted to check in to see if you’re alright.
Brigid: Yeah, as alright as currently possible, I guess.
Mr Canister: So… something’s not alright?
Brigid: Many things, but I’m not particularly eager to talk about them.
Mr Canister: Sure, of course.
Mr Canister: So… goodnight it is.
Brigid: Gnight.

Mr Canister: You forgot your linen bag at the hair salon.
Brigid: Shit, I have uni notes in there.
Brigid: I guess I can get them tomorrow morning? Before classes?
Mr Canister: I can bring it to you there.
Brigid: To my uni??
Mr Canister: Yeah, I study sociology there so I can catch you somewhere.
Brigid: Thanks, you’re kinda saving my life.

Mr Canister: How are you?
Brigid: Okayish.
Mr Canister: ??
Brigid: I&#39;ve just missed the latest bus from uni to our village so probably Uber it is.
Mr Canister: I’m still in town, I can give you a ride if you want to.
Brigid: Really? I’m interested. That’s always some money saved.
Mr Canister: Cool, I’ll be there in ten minutes.

Mr Canister: So I’ll pick you up at 7:30, right?
Brigid: Yeah. Thanks again for driving me to classes.
Mr Canister: No problem, I’m driving there anyway. You save money and I get nice company during rides. Advantages only, am I right?
Brigid: Right…

Mr Canister: You seemed upset in the car today. Everything okay?
Brigid: Honestly?
Mr Canister: Always ;)
Brigid: Not really, stuff is just getting worse and worse lately.
Mr Canister: What stuff?
Brigid: All of it?
Mr Canister: You know you can talk to me about everything, right?
Brigid: I guess…
Mr Canister: I’ve been told I’m a very good listener.
Brigid: Lucky me…

Mr Canister: How are you?
Mr Canister: Hopefully better than me.
Brigid: Something has happened?
Mr Canister: Nothing, I’ve just been feeling a bit down lately.
Mr Canister: You know, those days when you don’t even want to get out of bed, let alone your house.
Brigid: Yeah… I know them too well.

Mr Canister: My life is terrible and I hate it.
Brigid: ??
Mr Canister: My hamster has died today, my parents are fighting in a room next door, and it’s been a year since my girlfriend have broken up with me. She was a terrible partner and she still is a terrible person so I probably shouldn’t even miss her, but it still hurts. She was cheating on me. And my family, I guess they’re fine, but lately they’ve been having their downs and arguing about completely unimportant stuff. I can’t stand it here.
Brigid: Oh umm… I’m sorry?
Mr Canister: And now I feel so freaking lonely, no one to talk to. Maybe except for you.
Brigid: Uh have you tried therapy?
Mr Canister: Hah, you’re so funny. You always know how to make me laugh.

Mr Canister: Same place, same time?
Brigid: Sure.
Brigid: Thanks again for driving me to uni. It’s much more convenient than those rarely appearing buses.
Mr Canister: No problem, really :D

Mr Canister: Wassup?
Brigid: Uh, you don’t want to hear about it.
Mr Canister: Try me.
Brigid: Basically nothing new, just a bit worse.
Mr Canister: Oh dear…?
Brigid: Let’s say it’s a… family matter?
Mr Canister: Okay :( 
Mr Canister: I hope it will all turn out okay.
Mr Canister: You can always talk to me if you want.
Brigid: Thx. But it won&#39;t be okay.
Mr Canister: :(
Mr Canister: Or I can come visit you to cheer you up? I heard hugs help.
Brigid: Naah… thanks tho.

Mr Canister: Still sad?
Brigid: Yep.
Mr Canister: A hug?
Brigid: Nah, not a hugger.
Mr Canister: :(

Mr Canister: Um, I forgot to tell you in the car but you looked very pretty today :3
Brigid: Thx, I guess?

Mr Canister: Same time, same place?
Brigid: Actually I think I’ll take the bus this time.
Mr Canister: :(
Mr Canister: Why?
Brigid: My schedule changed a bit so the timing will be more fitting for me.
Mr Canister: :(

Mr Canister: What are you doing?
Brigid: Talking with my friend, Sam.
Mr Canister: Oh, I won’t be bothering you then.
Mr Canister: :(

Mr Canister: You’re free now?
Brigid: Uh… not really?
Mr Canister: :(
Mr Canister: Surely, you have better people to spend time with.
Brigid: No, I mean I’m studying for a final tomorrow.
Mr Canister: Oh. Good luck then :D

Mr Canister: Okay, so um, this is awkward. I was wondering. Would you ever consider going on a date with me?
Mr Canister: &lt;3
Brigid: Uh… I need to think about it.
Mr Canister: Oh. Okay. Sure. Take your time.

Mr Canister: So?
Brigid: So what?
Mr Canister: So what’s your answer?
Brigid: I must say no.
Mr Canister: Oh… :(
Mr Canister: Why?
Brigid: I gave it a lot of thought and even talked about it with some of my friends, and I think it’s better if we leave the romantic stuff out of it. I just don’t see you this way and I don’t even think I’m ready for a relationship at the moment. Besides, we are not even that close.
Mr Canister: We can get to know each other more.
Brigid: I… I’m not sure I want to. Let’s not pressure it. Sam said it might be better for me to get some distance.
Mr Canister: So Sam told you all of that?!
Brigid: No, he just… we were talking and I got to some conclusions and…
Mr Canister: Whatever.
Mr Canister: I don’t care.
Mr Canister: And neither do you. I’m nothing to you, am I not? Just a guy you use to get to the town faster.
Brigid: I never said anything like that!
Mr Canister: Sure, Brigid.
Mr Canister: See you around.

Mr Canister: Wanna grab a coffee?
Brigid: I can’t, I’m out of town.
Mr Canister: Shame :(
Mr Canister: Maybe next time :D
*I wasn’t out of town*

Mr Canister: You weren’t at my mom’s to get a haircut for a while. Do you want me to set an appointment for you?
Brigid: No, thanks.
Brigid: I’m growing my hair out.
*Again - a lie. I just changed the hair salon.*
